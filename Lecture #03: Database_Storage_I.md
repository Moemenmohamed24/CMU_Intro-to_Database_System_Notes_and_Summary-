# What is CXL?:

CXL stands for Compute Express Link. It's a very modern interconnect protocol developed to speed up communication between:
• The CPU (Central Processing Unit)
• and other devices such as GPUs, memory expanders, or accelerators.

CXL was designed to solve speed, latency, and compatibility issues that systems faced when adding hardware.

# SEQUENTIAL VS. RANDOM ACCESS

Sequential Access in Databases/Storage :
Better for large writes or massive data transfers.
Example: If you're going to record millions of rows at once in a table, sequential writes are faster because they write the data sequentially to the disk or SSD.
On a tape or HDD, sequential writes are much faster than random access.

Random Access in Databases/Storage :
Best for reading or updating individual data.
Example: If you want to retrieve a single row or modify a specific value in a table, random access is much faster because it doesn't need to iterate through all the data beforehand.
RAM and SSD are excellent for fast random access.

Using Both Together :
Database systems use sequential data storage in large files or logs.
They use random access to individual rows via indexes.
The idea: To take advantage of the combined speed of sequential writes and random reads.
